**`_compute_l10n_es_tbai_state()`** — `to_send` if TicketBAI required and no account_move yet; `sent` if document accepted

**`_process_saved_order()`** — Validates: above-limit orders must be invoiced; refunds require linked order invoicing

**`action_pos_order_paid()`** — EXTENDS `point_of_sale`. Posts to TicketBAI when paid without invoicing; on failure, retries the chain head then re-posts current order

**`_prepare_invoice_vals()`** — Blocks mixing TicketBAI-required and non-required orders in one batch; propagates refund reason

**`get_l10n_es_pos_tbai_qrurl()`** — Returns TicketBAI QR code URL from the accepted document

**`_l10n_es_tbai_post()`** — Creates `l10n_es_edi_tbai.document` if needed; posts via `_post_to_web_service()`; deletes rejected documents on retry

**`_l10n_es_tbai_get_values()`** — Builds XML values with base lines, gross prices, sign handling for refunds
